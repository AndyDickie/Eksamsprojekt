  <p>Worlde-online is based on the popular game Wordle. The goal is to guess a 5-letter word.
    The player has 6 guesses to attempt to guess the corect word. Every letter that is not present in the word is marked with a grey color,
    if the letter is correct but in the wrong place, it is marked with yellow, and lastly a correct letter placement results in the letter being marked green.
